# Vectra-AI
Scripts are written to fetch rules and certain detections from Vectra AI 
I have used Vectra API guide to simply fectch Vectra rules and certain detections this way we can analyze detection in bulk and create triage rules if required.
While running script please ensure to change the API key, Vectra URL and file path where data will be saved.
